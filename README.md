(Actually mini Amazon with a simple method)

## Introduction
In this assignment, I create a simulation of Amazon. The program allow users to create and manage their accounts and profiles, buy Products, add comment and rate them. The program designed using object-oriented programming principles.
##  Summary
In this project, I have used some techniques such as inheritance and Abstract method. Although I intended to use an interface, I was unable to find a suitable one. However, towards the end of the project, I realized that I could add multiple options to products. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I missed this opportunity.
I made the decision to **set a rate** for it, **add notifications** and implement a **search by using regular expressions** and include other features not documented. Additionally, I wanted to utilize my knowledge, so I incorporated JSON into my project.

If this is your question 'How you determined which entities need to be uniquely identifiable'
let me Tell you. At first, I created all classes related to the documentary ,then added constructors, getters, and setters based on what wrote in the documentary. However, as I was writing the code for the Main class, I realized that some methods or classes that I made were unnecessary, so I decided to delete them.

If you want to know about the big problem that I faced, I was trying to find a map API for my project to locate the addresses of customers. It took me a day but I couldn't find anything suitable because my country is under boycott. I asked my friends who are outside of my country to help me find a solution, but they were not able to find it. So eventually, I had to let it go.
And I had a problem with the seller's wallet ,but my TA helped me figure it out.
My biggest problem (or rather my biggest Mistake) in this project, was that I spent six days trying to make it with 'FXML'. Although I did learn some minimum 'CSS'. But I couldn't use 'FXML' clearly in my project. During the review with our TA, he said that ''First do it without graphics, and then when you have time, you can add them later. Manage your time effectively in relation to the project.''
When I heard the statement "Manage your time," I realized that I didn't actually waste my time. It was just that I started the project without having a clear purpose or a program related to my shop's programming...

Finally, in this project, I used a lot of resources from https://stackoverflow.com especially for the bonus object. I also sourced my emojis from https://www.emojiall.com/en/search_results. In my rating system, I used "ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ—ðŸŒ‘ " because I couldn't find a half star emoji.
Additionally, I used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org to determine the colour of my background and classify prices based on 'Higher Price' and 'Lower Price'."

So, everything that I have shared with those who have read about my project constitutes the entirety of what happened during its development.

## Conclusion
Although I did not include a graphical user interface (GUI) in this project due to time constraints and other projects, I plan to develop a GUI in the future. so if you want to revise it you can consider other factor that I missed it .
