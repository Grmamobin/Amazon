(Actually mini Amazon with a simple method)

## Introduction
In this assignment, I create a simulation of Amazon. The program allow users to create and manage their accounts and profiles, buy Products, add comment and rate them. The program designed using object-oriented programming principles.

in this project, I used a lot of resources from https://stackoverflow.com especially for the bonus object. I also sourced my emojis from https://www.emojiall.com/en/search_results. In my rating system, I used "ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ•ðŸŒ—ðŸŒ‘ " because I couldn't find a half star emoji.
Additionally, I used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org to determine the colour of my background and classify prices based on 'Higher Price' and 'Lower Price'.

So, everything that I have shared with those who have read about my project constitutes the entirety of what happened during its development.

## Conclusion
Although I did not include a graphical user interface (GUI) in this project due to time constraints and other projects, I plan to develop a GUI in the future. so if you want to revise it you can consider other factor that I missed it .
